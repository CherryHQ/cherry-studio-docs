## Explanation

- **Rank (UB)**: Ranking based on the Bradley-Terry model. This reflects a model's comprehensive performance in the arena and provides an **upper bound** estimate of its Elo score, helping understand its potential competitiveness.  
- **Model**: Name of the Large Language Model (LLM). Some model names may contain embedded links.  
- **Score**: Elo rating obtained through user votes in the arena. Elo is a relative ranking system—higher scores indicate better performance.

- **License**: Type of license agreement, e.g., Proprietary, Apache 2.0, MIT, etc.
