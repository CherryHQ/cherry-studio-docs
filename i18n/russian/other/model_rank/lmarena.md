We are translating from Chinese to Russian. The document is an LLM Arena Leaderboard. We must follow all translation rules, especially preserving Markdown syntax, links, and technical terms.
 Steps:
 1. Translate only the text content that will be displayed to the user.
 2. Preserve all Markdown formatting (headings, tables, code blocks, etc.) and structural elements.
 3. Translate comments within code blocks if any, but in this document there are no code blocks with comments to translate.
 4. Preserve links and image paths unchanged.
 5. Maintain GitBook-style hint blocks (translate content inside, but keep tags).
 6. The document does not have a frontmatter, so we skip that.
 7. Do not add any extra explanations.

 Important: The table contains a lot of untranslatable content (model names, links, numbers, etc.). We only translate the headers and the explanatory text.

 We note that the table has a header row and many data rows. The data rows must remain unchanged except for the "模型名" column which has the model names and links. We must not change the links or the model names, but note that the model names are in English and should remain as is.

 However, looking at the table, the "模型名" column has the model name as a link. The link text is in English and should not be translated. The other columns are either numbers or English terms (like "Proprietary", "MIT", etc.) and should remain as is.

 Also note: The "知识截止日期" column has some Chinese text ("暂无数据") which should be translated to Russian.

 But wait: the translation rules say to preserve GitHub terminology and also to preserve version numbers, file paths, etc. The entire table data should be left as is except for the "暂无数据" which appears in the "知识截止日期" column. However, the rules say to translate textual content. Since the table is part of the displayed content, we must translate the "暂无数据" in the data cells.

 However, the rule also says: "Translate only the textual content that will be displayed to the user." and "the code, commands, file names, URLs, version numbers, and other technical syntax within code blocks or other parts of the document should remain untranslated."

 In the table, "暂无数据" is a piece of text that means "no data available". It is not a technical term, so we should translate it.

 Approach for the table:
  - The table header: translate the header names (like "排名(UB)", "排名(StyleCtrl)", etc.) to Russian.
  - The data rows: leave the numbers, model names (which are in English), service provider names (in English), license types (in English) as is, but translate the Chinese text "暂无数据" in the "知识截止日期" column to Russian.

 However, note that the "服务商" column has some Chinese entries (e.g., "阿里", "深度求索", "腾讯") and also English ones. We need to translate the Chinese company names to Russian? But the rule says to preserve GitHub-specific terminology and technical syntax. The service providers are names of companies. Some are in Chinese, some in English. We should translate the Chinese company names to Russian? However, in the context of an international leaderboard, company names are often kept in their original form or in a commonly known form. But the instruction says to translate textual content.

 However, note: the rule says "Preserve all GitHub-specific terminology (e.g., pull request, fork, commit, repository) in its original form." and "Preserve all URLs, file paths, and version numbers". Company names are not GitHub-specific terminology. Therefore, we should translate the Chinese company names to Russian.

 But looking at the table, the service providers are given in Chinese for some and in English for others. For example, in row 3: "Z.ai" (which is in English) and row 4: "xAI" (English). But in row 121: "01 AI" and in row 78: "01 AI" (which is in English). However, in row 121, there is a note: "01 AI" is in English. Also, in row 161: "智谱 AI" is in Chinese. So we should translate "智谱 AI" to Russian? But note that "智谱 AI" is the name of the company. We might not have a standard translation.

 We must decide: 
  According to the rules, we are to translate textual content. Company names are proper nouns, but if they are written in Chinese, we might transliterate or provide a common translation. However, the rule does not specify. To be safe, we will transliterate the Chinese company names to Russian using standard transliteration. But note: some companies are known by their English name internationally. However, the instruction says "translate textual content", so we will translate the Chinese company names to Russian.

 But wait, the rule also says: "Preserve all URLs, file paths, and version numbers exactly as in the original." and company names are not URLs or version numbers. So we translate.

 However, after reconsidering: the leaderboard might be used internationally and the company names are identifiers. It might be better to leave them in the original, but the rule says to translate textual content. Since the user requested translation to Russian, we should translate the Chinese text. 

 But note: the original document uses Chinese for some service providers and English for others. We will translate the Chinese service provider names to Russian, while leaving the English ones as is.

 Example: 
   "阿里" -> "Алибаба" (but actually it's Alibaba, which is known in Russian as Алибаба) 
   "深度求索" -> "DeepSeek" (but the original Chinese is the name of the company) -> we can transliterate: "Шэньду Цюсо" but that's not standard. Alternatively, since the company is known as DeepSeek in English, and the same row uses "DeepSeek" in the license, we should use the English name? 

 Actually, in the table, for "深度求索" they also use "DeepSeek" in the license column? Let me look: In row 8: "DeepSeek" in the service provider column is written in English? Actually, in row 8 it's "DeepSeek". So maybe in the original, the service provider column is already in English for those companies. 

 But wait, in row 78: "01 AI" is in English. In row 121: "01 AI" is in English. In row 161: "智谱 AI" is in Chinese. So row 161: 智谱 AI -> we should translate to Russian? 

 However, 智谱 AI is the Chinese name of the company, and their official English name is "Zhipu AI". So in the license column of row 58: "Zhipu" (which is the English). So to be consistent, we should write the company name in Russian using the English name? Or we can write it in Russian using the English name since it's a proper noun? 

 Since the rule is to translate textual content, and if the company has an official English name, we use that? But the rule does not specify. 

 Given the complexity and to avoid inconsistency, I will leave the service provider names as they appear in the original (whether in Chinese or English) because they are proper nouns. However, the instruction says to translate, so if the service provider name is in Chinese, we must translate it to Russian.

 We decide to transliterate the Chinese company names to Russian using the Pinyin system? 

 However, common practice in Russian is to use established transliterations for well-known companies. For example:
   Alibaba -> Алибаба
   Tencent -> Тенцент
   Baidu -> Байду

 But for less known ones, we transliterate. 

 Since I don't know the standard for every company, and to be consistent, I will use the following approach:
   For companies that are well-known internationally, use the established Russian name if it exists, otherwise transliterate.
   Alternatively, since this is a technical leaderboard, the names might be kept in English.

 But note: the rule says to translate. So we will translate the Chinese company names to Russian by transliterating.

 For example:
   "智谱 AI" -> "Zhipu AI" (but this is English) -> actually, we should use the English name if it's available? 

 Let's look at the official website: 智谱 AI is Zhipu AI. So we should use "Zhipu AI" (as in the license column). But wait, in the original table, row 87: "Zhipu AI" is already in English. So maybe the author uses the English name in the service provider column? 

 After reviewing the table data, I see that the service provider column is a mix of English and Chinese. But in the interest of consistency and because these are proper nouns, and to avoid introducing errors, we will not translate the service provider names. Instead, we leave them as in the original. 

 This decision is based on the fact that company names are proper nouns and are not typically translated, but transliterated. However, the rule says to translate textual content. This is a gray area.

 Since the rule says "Translate only the textual content that will be displayed to the user", and company names are part of the textual content, we are required to translate them. But note that the rule also says "Preserve all GitHub-specific terminology", and company names are not that. 

 I think the safest is to transliterate the Chinese company names to Russian using a
