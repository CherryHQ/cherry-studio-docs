# How to Ask Questions Effectively

CherryStudio is a free and open source project. As the project grows, the workload of the project team also increases day by day. In order to reduce the cost of communication as well as to quickly and efficiently solve your problems, we hope that before you ask a question, as far as possible, according to the following steps and ways to deal with the problems encountered, for the project team to set aside more time for the maintenance and development of the project. Thank you for your cooperation!



## 1. Document Browsing & Searching

Most of the basics can be solved by consulting the documentation.

* The features and usage issues of the software can be checked in the [Feature Introduction](../cherrystudio/preview/) document.
* Frequently asked questions will be included on the [FAQ](faq.md) page. You can first check the FAQ page to see if there is a solution.
* Complex problems can be solved directly through searching;
* Be sure to carefully read the content of the hint boxes in each document, which can help you avoid many problems.
* Check or search the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/issues) page for similar problems and solutions.



## 2. Search on Web & Ask AI

For issues unrelated to client functionality (such as model errors, unexpected responses, parameter settings, etc.), it is recommended to first search for relevant solutions online, or describe the error content and problem to an AI to find solutions.



## 3. Ask Questions in the Official Community & Submit Issues on Github

If the above steps one and two do not provide an answer or solve your problem, you can go to the official [Telegram channel](https://t.me/CherryStudioAI), [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/wez8HtpxqQ), or QQ group ([one-click access](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?authKey=xe5nfGVZLMYnlJq%2F%2B4kN03YWcDBB2lnD7tc9rWus2mxS0JHUbOzk79cO7MYuqyGR\&k=UKVgl3YPHmwPaU8qeO1VG03NcUkACKsc\&noverify=0)) to describe the problem in detail and seek help.

1. If the model reports an error, please provide a complete screenshot of the interface and the error information from the console. Sensitive information can be redacted, but the **model name**, **parameter settings**, and **error content** must be retained in the screenshot. [Click here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Cj2FUNM601oTkFwFFsXJ/s/TJpzghp1hMtRkf9kutYX/~/changes/10/questions-and-feedback/faq#how-to-view-console-errors) to see how to view the console error information.
2.  If it's a software bug, please provide <mark style="background-color:green;">a specific error description</mark> and <mark style="background-color:green;">detailed steps to reproduce it</mark>, so that developers can debug and fix it. If it's an occasional problem that cannot be reproduced, please describe the relevant scenarios, background, and configuration parameters as detailed as possible when the problem occurred.

    In addition to this, you also need to include <mark style="background-color:green;">platform information</mark> (Windows, Mac, or Linux), <mark style="background-color:green;">software version number</mark>, and other information in the problem description.
