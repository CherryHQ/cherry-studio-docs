### ‚ú® Important Notes and Tips

*   **Number of Search Results**:
    *   By default, Cherry Studio may be configured to return around **6** search result summaries, which is a balance between speed and information volume.
    *   If the settings provide an option, you can try to **increase the number of returned results**. Doing so can provide richer and more comprehensive web information, helping to cover more aspects of your query.

*   **Performance and Limitations**:
    *   **Please note**: Requesting more search results will **increase processing time**, thereby **reducing the speed of search and response**.
    *   At the same time, fetching too much web content may **exceed the model's context length limit**, which can sometimes lead to **information loss, incomplete responses, or errors**.
*   **Recommendations**:
    *   When you first start, it's recommended to keep the default settings.
    *   If you find the information insufficient, adjust the number of results (if configurable) according to your specific needs and acceptable waiting time.
    *   If you don't need real-time information, remember to **click the web search icon on the toolbar again** to **disable** it, avoiding unnecessary searches and potential delays.
