### ‚ú® Key Notes and Tips

* **Number of Search Results**:
  * By default, Cherry Studio may be configured to return about **6** search result summaries to balance speed and information quantity.
  *   If available in settings, try **increasing the number of returned results**. This provides richer, more comprehensive online information and helps cover broader aspects of your query.

* **Performance and Limitations**:
  * **Note**: Requesting more search results **increases processing time**, slowing down search and response speed.
  * Fetching excessive web content may **exceed the model's context length limit**, potentially causing **information loss, incomplete replies, or errors**.  
* **Recommendations**:
  * Start with default settings initially.
  * Adjust the result count (if configurable) based on your needs and acceptable wait times when information is insufficient.
  * Disable the feature when not needed: **Click the web search icon üåê again** to **turn it off**, avoiding unnecessary searches and potential delays.
