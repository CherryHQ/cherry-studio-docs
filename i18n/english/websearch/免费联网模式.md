### ‚ú® Important Notes and Tips

*   **Number of Search Results**:
    *   By default, Cherry Studio may be configured to return approximately **6** search result summaries, which is a setting that balances speed and information volume.
    *   If an option is provided in the settings, you can try to **increase the number of returned results**. Doing so can provide richer, more comprehensive web information, helping to cover more aspects of your query.

*   **Performance and Limitations**:
    *   **Please note**: Requesting more search results will **increase processing time**, thereby **reducing the speed of search and response**.
    *   Additionally, fetching too much web content may also **exceed the context length limit** that the model can handle, which can sometimes lead to **information loss, incomplete replies, or errors**.
*   **Suggestions**:
    *   When first using it, it is recommended to keep the default settings.
    *   If you find the information insufficient, adjust the number of results appropriately (if configurable) based on your specific needs and acceptable waiting time.
    *   If real-time information is not needed, remember to **click the web search icon on the toolbar again** to **turn it off**, to avoid unnecessary searches and potential delays.
