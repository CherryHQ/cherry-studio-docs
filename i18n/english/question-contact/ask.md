# How to Ask Questions Effectively

Cherry Studio is a free and open-source project. As the project grows, the workload for the project team has also increased. To reduce communication costs and resolve your issues quickly and efficiently, we hope that you will follow the steps and methods below to handle problems before asking questions. This will allow the project team more time to focus on project maintenance and development. Thank you for your cooperation!

## 1. Check and Search the Documentation

Most basic questions can be solved by carefully reading the documentation.

*   For questions about the software's features and usage, you can check the [Feature Introduction](../cherrystudio/preview/) documentation.
*   Frequently asked questions are collected on the [FAQ](questions.md) page. You can check there first for solutions.
*   For more complex issues, you can try solving them directly by searching or asking in the search bar.
*   Be sure to carefully read the content in the hint boxes within each document, as this can help you avoid many problems.
*   Check or search the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/issues) page for similar problems and solutions.

## 2. Search Online, Ask an AI

For issues unrelated to the client's functionality (such as model errors, unexpected responses, or parameter settings), it is recommended to first search online for relevant solutions or describe the error message and problem to an AI to find a solution.

## 3. Ask in Official Communities or Create a GitHub Issue

If the first two steps did not provide an answer or solve your problem, you can describe your issue in detail and seek help in our official [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/CherryStudioAI), [Discord Channel](https://discord.com/invite/wez8HtpxqQ), or [QQ Group](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] ([Click to Join](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?authKey=xe5nfGVZLMYnlJq%2F%2B4kN03YWcDBB2lnD7tc9rWus2mxS0JHUbOzk79cO7MYuqyGR\&k=UKVgl3YPHmwPaU8qeO1VG03NcUkACKsc\&noverify=0)).

1.  If it's a model error, please provide a complete screenshot of the interface and the console error message. You can censor sensitive information, but the model name, parameter settings, and error content must be visible in the screenshot. To learn how to view console error messages, [click here](questions.md#kong-zhi-tai-bao-cuo-cha-kan-fang-fa).
2.  If it's a software bug, please provide a <mark style="background-color:green;">specific error description</mark> and <mark style="background-color:green;">detailed</mark> [<mark style="background-color:green;">reproduction</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] <mark style="background-color:green;">steps</mark> to help developers debug and fix it. If it's an intermittent issue that cannot be reproduced, please describe the relevant scenarios, context, and configuration parameters when the problem occurred in as much detail as possible.\
    In addition, you also need to include <mark style="background-color:green;">platform information</mark> (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and the <mark style="background-color:green;">software version number</mark> in your problem description.
