## Effective Questioning Methods

Cherry Studio is a free and open-source project. As the project grows, the workload of the team increases significantly. To reduce communication costs and efficiently resolve your issues, we encourage everyone to follow the steps below when reporting problems. This will allow our team to dedicate more time to project maintenance and development. Thank you for your cooperation!

### 1. Documentation Review and Search

Most basic problems can be resolved by carefully reviewing the documentation:

* Functionality and usage questions can be answered in the [Feature Introduction](../cherrystudio/preview/) documentation;
* High-frequency issues are compiled on the [FAQ](questions.md) pageâ€”check there first for solutions;
* Complex questions can often be resolved through search or using the search bar;
* Carefully read all hint boxes in documents to avoid many common issues;
* Check existing solutions in the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/issues).

### 2. Web Search or Consult AI

For model-related issues unrelated to client functionality (e.g., model errors, unexpected responses, parameter settings):

* Search online for solutions first;
* Provide error messages to AI assistants for resolution suggestions.

### 3. Ask in Official Communities or File GitHub Issues

If steps 1-2 don't solve your problem:

* Seek help in our official [Telegram](https://t.me/CherryStudioAI), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wez8HtpxqQ), or [QQ Group](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] ([Join Now](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?authKey=xe5nfGVZLMYnlJq%2F%2B4kN03YWcDBB2lnD7tc9rWus2mxS0JHUbOzk79cO7MYuqyGR\&k=UKVgl3YPHmwPaU8qeO1VG03NcUkACKsc\&noverify=0))\

  When reporting:

1. **For model errors:**
   * Provide full screenshots with error messages visible
   * Include console errors ([Viewing Method](questions.md#kong-zhi-tai-bao-cuo-cha-kan-fang-fa))
   * Sensitive information can be redacted, but keep model names, parameters, and error details\
     \

2. **For software bugs:**
   * Give <mark style="background-color:green;">detailed error descriptions</mark>
   * Provide <mark style="background-color:green;">precise reproduction</mark> steps[^2]
   * Include OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) and software version number
   * For intermittent issues, describe scenarios and configurations comprehensively
