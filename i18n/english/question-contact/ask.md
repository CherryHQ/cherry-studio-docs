Cherry Studio is a free and open-source project. As the project grows, the workload of the project team also increases. To reduce communication costs and effectively and efficiently solve your problems, we hope everyone can address issues encountered by following the steps and methods below as much as possible before asking questions, allowing the project team more time to focus on project maintenance and development. Thank you for your cooperation!

## I. Document Review and Search

Most basic problems can usually be solved by carefully reviewing the documentation.

*   Functionality and usage issues of the software can be found in the [Features Introduction](../cherrystudio/preview/) documentation;
*   Frequently asked questions are collected on the [FAQ](questions.md) page. You can check the FAQ page first to see if there's a solution;
*   More complex problems can be solved directly by searching or asking in the search bar;
*   Be sure to carefully read the hint box content in each document; it can help you avoid many problems;
*   Check or search the GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio/issues) page for similar issues and solutions.

## II. Web Search, Asking AI

For issues unrelated to client functionality, such as model usage (e.g., model errors, unexpected responses, parameter settings), it is recommended to first search online for relevant solutions, or describe the error content and problem to AI to find solutions.

## III. Ask in Official Communities or Submit an Issue on GitHub

If the above two steps (I and II) did not provide an answer or solve your problem, you can go to the official [TG channel](https://t.me/CherryStudioAI), [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/wez8HtpxqQ), [QQ group ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] ([One-click to join](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?authKey=xe5nfGVZLMYnlJq%2F%2B4kN03YWcDBB2lnD7tc9rWus2mxS0JHUbOzk79cO7MYuqyGR\&k=UKVgl3YPHmwPaU8qeO1VG03NcUkACKsc\&noverify=0)) to describe the problem in detail and seek help.

1.  If it's a model error, please provide a complete screenshot of the interface and console error messages. Sensitive information can be censored, but the model name, parameter settings, and error content must be kept in the screenshot. To view console error messages, [click here](questions.md#kong-zhi-tai-bao-cuo-cha-kan-fang-fa).
2.  If it's a software bug, please provide a <mark style="background-color:green;">specific error description</mark> and <mark style="background-color:green;">detailed</mark> [<mark style="background-color:green;">reproduction</mark>](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] <mark style="background-color:green;">steps</mark> to facilitate debugging and fixing by developers. If it's an occasional problem that cannot be reproduced, please describe the relevant scenarios, background, and configuration parameters when the problem occurred as detailed as possible.\
    In addition, you also need to include <mark style="background-color:green;">platform information</mark> (Windows, Mac, or Linux) and <mark style="background-color:green;">software version number</mark> in the problem description.
