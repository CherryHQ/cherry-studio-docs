## Common Error Codes

*   **4xx (Client Error Status Codes)**: Generally, these indicate issues like incorrect request syntax, authentication failure, or authorization failure, preventing the request from being completed.
*   **5xx (Server Error Status Codes)**: Generally, these indicate server-side errors, such as server downtime or request processing timeouts.

| Error Code | Possible Scenario                                                      | Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## How to View Console Errors

*   After clicking the Cherry Studio client window, press the shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (Mac: <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>).

{% hint style="info" %}
*   The currently active window must be the Cherry Studio client window to open the console;
*   You need to open the console first, then click test or initiate a conversation and other requests to collect request information.
{% endhint %}

*   In the popped-up console window, click <mark style="color:blue;">`Network`</mark> → click to view the last <mark style="color:red;">`completions`</mark> marked with a red <mark style="color:red;">`×`</mark> at ② _(when encountering errors in conversation, translation, model connectivity checks, etc.)_ or <mark style="color:red;">`generations`</mark> _(when encountering errors in drawing)_ → click <mark style="color:blue;">`Response`</mark> to view the complete returned content (area ④ in the figure).

> If you cannot determine the cause of the error, please send a screenshot of this interface to the [Official Communication Group](https://t.me/CherryStudioAI) for assistance.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This inspection method can be used not only to obtain error messages during conversations but also during model testing, knowledge base addition, drawing, etc. In any case, you need to open the debug window first and then perform the request operation to get the request information.

{% hint style="info" %}
The name in the Name column (② in the figure above) will vary in different scenarios.

Conversation, translation, model check: <mark style="color:red;">`completions`</mark>

Drawing: <mark style="color:red;">`generations`</mark>

Knowledge base creation: <mark style="color:red;">`embeddings`</mark>
{% endhint %}

## Formulas not rendered / Formula rendering errors

*   If formulas are not rendered and instead display as formula code, check if the formulas have delimiters.

> **Delimiter usage**
>
> _Inline formulas_
>
> *   Use a single dollar sign: `$formula$`
> *   Or use `\(` and `\)`, e.g.: `\(formula\)`
>
> _Block formulas_
>
> *   Use double dollar signs: `$$formula$$`
> *   Or use `\[formula\]`
> *   Example: `$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$`\
>     $$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$

*   Formula rendering errors/garbled text often occur when formulas contain Chinese content; try switching the formula engine to KateX.

## Failed to create knowledge base / Failed to get embedding dimensions

1.  Model status unavailable

> Confirm whether the service provider supports the model or whether the model service status is normal for the service provider.

2.  Used a non-embedding model

***

## Model cannot recognize images / Unable to upload or select images

First, you need to confirm whether the model supports image recognition. Cherry Studio categorizes popular models; those with an eye icon after the model name support image recognition.

Image recognition models support image file uploads. If the model's functionality is not correctly matched, you can find the model in the corresponding service provider's model list, click the settings button after its name, and check the image option.

Specific model information can be found and reviewed with the corresponding service provider. Similar to embedding models, models that do not support vision do not need to have image functionality forcibly enabled, and checking the image option will have no effect.
