# Privacy Policy

Welcome to Cherry Studio (“this software” or “we”). We highly value your privacy protection. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your personal information and data. Please carefully read and understand this policy before using the software:

## I. Scope of Information Collection

To optimize user experience and improve software quality, we may anonymously collect the following non-personal information only:

• Software version information;

• Activity and usage frequency of software functions;

• Anonymous crash reports and error logs;

The above information is fully anonymized, does not involve any personally identifiable data, and cannot be associated with your personal information.

## II. Information We Do NOT Collect

To maximize the protection of your privacy and security, we explicitly promise that we will:

• NOT collect, store, transmit, or process any API Key information for model services that you input into this software;

• NOT collect, store, transmit, or process any conversational data generated while using this software, including but not limited to chat content, instruction data, knowledge base data, vector data, and other customized content;

• NOT collect, store, transmit, or process any personally identifiable sensitive information.

## III. Data Interaction Description

This software uses the third-party model service provider’s API Key that you apply for and configure independently, to implement related model calls and conversation functionalities. The model services (such as large models, API interfaces, etc.) you use are provided by the third-party providers you choose and are entirely their responsibility. Cherry Studio acts solely as a local tool offering the interface to call third-party model services.

### Therefore:

• All conversational data generated by your interaction with the large model services is independent of Cherry Studio. We neither participate in data storage nor perform any form of data transmission or relay;

• You are responsible for reviewing and accepting the privacy policy and related policies of the corresponding third-party model service providers. Privacy policies of these services are available on each provider’s official website.

## IV. Third-party Model Service Providers’ Privacy Policy Statement

You shall independently bear privacy risks potentially involved with third-party model service providers. Specific privacy policies, data security measures, and relevant responsibilities can be found on the official websites of the selected model service providers. We do not assume any liability in this regard.

## V. Agreement Updates and Amendments

This policy may be adjusted appropriately according to software version updates. Please check it regularly. In the event of substantial changes to this policy, we will notify you in an appropriate manner.

## VI. Contact Us
