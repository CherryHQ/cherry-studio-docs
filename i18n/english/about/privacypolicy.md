Welcome to Cherry Studio (hereinafter referred to as "this software" or "we"). We highly value your privacy protection. This privacy policy will explain how we handle and protect your personal information and data. Please read and understand this agreement carefully before using this software:

## I. Scope of Information We Collect

To optimize user experience and improve software quality, we may only anonymously collect the following non-personal information:

*   Software version information;
*   Software feature activity and usage frequency;
*   Anonymous crash and error log information;

The above information is completely anonymous, does not involve any personal identity data, and cannot be linked to your personal information.

## II. Information We Will Not Collect

To maximize the protection of your privacy, we explicitly commit:

*   We will not collect, save, transmit, or process your model service API Key information entered into this software;
*   We will not collect, save, transmit, or process any conversation data generated during your use of this software, including but not limited to chat content, instruction information, knowledge base information, vector data, and other custom content;
*   We will not collect, save, transmit, or process any sensitive information that can identify individuals.

## III. Data Interaction Description

This software uses the API Keys of third-party model service providers that you apply for and configure yourself, to complete the invocation of relevant models and conversation functions. The model services you use (such as large language models, API interfaces, etc.) are provided by your chosen third-party providers and are entirely their responsibility. Cherry Studio only acts as a local tool to provide interface invocation functions with third-party model services.

Therefore:

*   All conversation data generated between you and the large model service is unrelated to Cherry Studio. We do not participate in data storage, nor do we perform any form of data transmission or relay;
*   You need to review and accept the privacy policies and relevant policies of the corresponding third-party model service providers. The privacy policies for these services can be viewed on the official websites of each provider.

## IV. Third-Party Model Service Provider Privacy Policy Statement

You are solely responsible for the privacy risks that may be involved in using third-party model service providers. For specific privacy policies, data security measures, and related responsibilities, please refer to the relevant content on the official website of the selected model service provider. We do not bear any responsibility for this.
