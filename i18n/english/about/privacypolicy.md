# Privacy Policy

Welcome to Cherry Studio (hereinafter referred to as "this software" or "we"). We place a high value on protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your personal information and data. Please read and understand this policy carefully before using this software:

## I. Scope of Information We Collect

To optimize user experience and improve software quality, we may only collect the following anonymous, non-personal information:

• Software version information;
• Activity and usage frequency of software features;
• Anonymous crash and error log information;

The above information is completely anonymous, does not involve any personally identifiable data, and cannot be associated with your personal information.

## II. Information We Do Not Collect

To maximize the protection of your privacy and security, we explicitly promise:

• We will not collect, save, transmit, or process the model service API Key information you enter into this software;
• We will not collect, save, transmit, or process any conversation data generated during your use of this software, including but not limited to chat content, command information, knowledge base information, vector data, and other custom content;
• We will not collect, save, transmit, or process any personally identifiable sensitive information.

## III. Data Interaction Description

This software uses the API Key from a third-party model service provider that you apply for and configure yourself to perform model calls and conversation functions. The model services you use (e.g., large models, API interfaces, etc.) are provided by and are the sole responsibility of the third-party provider you choose. Cherry Studio only acts as a local tool to provide the interface calling function with third-party model services.

Therefore:

• All conversation data generated between you and the large model service is unrelated to Cherry Studio. We do not participate in data storage, nor do we conduct any form of data transmission or relay;
• You need to review and accept the privacy policies and related terms of the corresponding third-party model service providers. The privacy policies for these services can be found on the official websites of each provider.

## IV. Third-Party Model Service Provider Privacy Policy Statement

You are solely responsible for any privacy risks that may arise from using third-party model service providers. For specific privacy policies, data security measures, and related liabilities, please refer to the relevant content on the official website of your chosen model service provider. We assume no responsibility for this.

## V. Agreement Updates and Modifications

This policy may be adjusted appropriately with software version updates. Please check it regularly. When substantial changes to the policy occur, we will notify you in an appropriate manner.

## VI. Contact Us
