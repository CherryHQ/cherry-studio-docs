## 1. Scope of Information We Collect

To optimize user experience and improve software quality, we may only collect the following anonymous non-personal information:
• Software version information;
• Function activity and usage frequency;
• Anonymous crash and error log information;

The above information is completely anonymous, does not involve any personally identifiable data, and cannot be associated with your personal information.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

To maximize the protection of your privacy, we explicitly commit:

## 3. Data Interaction Description

This software uses the API Key of third-party model service providers that you apply for and configure yourself to complete model invocation and conversation functions. The model services you use (such as large language models, API interfaces, etc.) are provided and fully managed by the third-party provider you choose, and Cherry Studio only serves as a local tool providing interface invocation functionality with third-party model services.
