# Default Model Settings

## Default Assistant Model

When an assistant does not have a default assistant model set, the model selected by default in a new conversation will be the one set here.

The model set here is also used for optimizing prompts and the pop-up text assistant.

## Topic Naming Model

After each conversation, a model is called to generate a topic name for the conversation. The model set here is the one used for naming.

## Translation Model

The translation function in input boxes for conversations, drawing, etc., and the translation model on the translation interface all use the model set here.

## Quick Assistant Model

The model used by the quick assistant feature. For details, see [Quick Assistant](../kuai-jie-zhu-shou.md)
