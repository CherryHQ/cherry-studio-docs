## Agents

The Agents page is a hub for assistants. Here, you can select or search for the model presets you want. Clicking on a card will add the assistant to the assistant list on the chat page.

You can also edit and create your own assistants on this page.

* Click on `My`, then click on `Create Agent` to start creating your own assistant.

{% hint style="info" %}
The button in the upper right corner of the prompt input box is for AI-optimizing the prompt. Clicking it will overwrite the original text. The model used is the [Global Default Assistant Model](../../cherrystudio/preview/broken-eference/).
