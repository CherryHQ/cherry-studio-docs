# Default Models

## Default Assistant Model

When the assistant does not have a default assistant model set, the model selected by default in its new conversations will be the model set here.

Additionally, the model used for optimizing prompts when creating a new assistant is also the model set here.

## Topic Naming Model

After each conversation, a model will be called to generate a topic name for the conversation. The model set here is the model used for naming.

## Translation Model

The translation function in the input boxes for conversations, paintings, etc., and the translation model in the translation interface all use the model set here.
