# Default Model Settings

## Default Assistant Model

When an assistant has not set a default assistant model, the model selected by default in its new conversations is the model set here.

When creating a new assistant, the model used for prompt optimization and by quick assistants is also the model set here.

## Topic Naming Model

After each conversation, a model is called to generate a topic name for the conversation. The model set here is the one used for the naming process.

## Translation Model

The translation function in input boxes for conversations, painting, etc., and the translation model on the translation interface all use the model set here.
