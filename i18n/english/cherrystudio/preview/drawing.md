# Painting

The painting feature currently supports models from DMXAPI, TokenFlux, AiHubMix, and [SiliconCloud](../../pre-basic/providers/siliconcloud.md). You can register an account at [SiliconCloud](https://www.siliconflow.cn/) and [add it as a provider](settings/providers.md) to use it.

For questions about parameters, you can hover over the `?` in the corresponding area to see the description.

{% hint style="info" %}
More providers will be added in the future. Stay tuned.
