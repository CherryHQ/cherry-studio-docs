# Drawing

The drawing feature currently supports painting models from DMXAPI, TokenFlux, AiHubMix, and [SiliconFlow](../../pre-basic/providers/siliconcloud.md). You can register an account at [SiliconFlow](https://www.siliconflow.cn/) and [add it as a provider](settings/providers.md) to use this feature.

For questions about parameters, hover your mouse over the `?` icon in corresponding areas to view descriptions.

{% hint style="info" %}
More providers will be added in the future. Stay tuned.
