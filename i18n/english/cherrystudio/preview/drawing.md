The painting function currently supports painting models from DMXAPI, TokenFlux, AiHubMix, and [Siliconflow](../../pre-basic/providers/siliconcloud.md). You can go to [Siliconflow](https://www.siliconflow.cn/) to register an account and [add it to providers](settings/providers.md) for use.

For questions about parameters, you can hover your mouse over the `?` in the corresponding area to view the introduction.

{% hint style="info" %}
More providers will be added in the future, so please stay tuned.
