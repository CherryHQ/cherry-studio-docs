# Infini-AI

Are you experiencing this: having 26 insightful articles saved in your WeChat Favorites that you never open again, more than 10 files scattered in a "study materials" folder on your computer, or trying to find a theory you read six months ago but only remembering a few keywords. When the daily amount of information exceeds your brain's processing limit, 90% of valuable knowledge is forgotten within 72 hours.
Now, by building a personal knowledge base with the Infini-AI Large Model Service Platform API + Cherry Studio, you can transform those dust-gathering WeChat articles and fragmented course content into structured knowledge for precise retrieval.

### I. Building a Personal Knowledge Base

#### 1. Infini-AI API Service: The "Thinking Hub" of Your Knowledge Base, Easy-to-Use and Stable

As the "thinking hub" of the knowledge base, the Infini-AI Large Model Service Platform offers model versions like the full-power DeepSeek R1, providing stable API services. **Currently, it's free to use with no barriers after registration.** It supports mainstream embedding models like bge and jina for building knowledge bases. **The platform also continuously updates with the latest, most powerful, and stable open-source model services**, including various modalities such as images, videos, and voice.

#### 2. Cherry Studio: Build a Knowledge Base with Zero Code

Cherry Studio is an easy-to-use AI tool. Compared to the 1-2 month deployment cycle required for RAG knowledge base development, this tool's advantage is its support for **zero-code operation.** You can import multiple formats like Markdown/PDF/webpages with one click. A 40MB file can be parsed in 1 minute. Additionally, you can add local computer folders, article URLs from WeChat Favorites, and course notes.

### II. Build Your Exclusive Knowledge Butler in 3 Steps

#### Step 1: Basic Preparation

1.  Visit the official Cherry Studio website to download the appropriate version (https://cherry-ai.com/)
2.  Register an account: Log in to the Infini-AI Large Model Service Platform (https://cloud.infini-ai.com/genstudio/model?cherrystudio)

After completing the steps above, you can use Infini-AI's API service in Cherry Studio by selecting the desired large model during interaction.
For convenience, you can also set a "Default Model" here.
