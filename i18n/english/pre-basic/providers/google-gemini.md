# Google Gemini

## Obtaining API Key

* Before obtaining the Gemini API key, you need a Google Cloud project (skip this step if you already have one).
* Go to [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) to create a project, fill in the project name, and click "Create Project".

* Find the Gemini service provider and enter the key you just obtained.
