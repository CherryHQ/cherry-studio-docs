# Google Gemini

## Get API Key

*   Before obtaining a Gemini API key, you need to have a Google Cloud project (if you already have one, you can skip this process).
*   Go to [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) to create a project, fill in the project name, and click Create Project.

- In China, except for Taiwan, Google Gemini services cannot be used directly. You need to resolve the proxy issue on your own.
