* Paste the key you just copied.
* Go back to the page where you got the API Key and copy the root address from the browser's address bar, for example:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p><strong>You only need to copy https://xxx.xxx.com; the "/" and the content after it are not needed.</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
* When the address is an IP + port, fill in http://IP:port, for example: http://127.0.0.1:3000
* Strictly distinguish between `http` and `https`. If SSL is not enabled, do not use https.
{% endhint %}

* Add models (click Manage to automatically fetch or manually enter them) and toggle the switch in the upper right corner to enable them.

Other OneAPI themes may have different interfaces, but the method for adding them is the same as the process described above.
