To enable every developer and user to easily experience the capabilities of cutting-edge large models, **Zhipu has opened up the GLM-4.5-Air model to Cherry Studio users for free**. As an efficient foundational model specifically designed for Agent applications, GLM-4.5-Air achieves an excellent balance between performance and cost, making it an ideal choice for building intelligent applications.

***

**üöÄ What is GLM-4.5-Air?**

GLM-4.5-Air is Zhipu's latest high-performance language model, adopting an advanced **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture**, which significantly reduces computational resource consumption while maintaining excellent inference capabilities.

*   **Total Parameters: 106 Billion**
*   **Active Parameters: 12 Billion**

Through streamlined design, GLM-4.5-Air achieves higher inference efficiency, suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments, while still capable of handling complex tasks.

**üìö Unified Training Process, Solidifying the Intelligent Foundation**

GLM-4.5-Air shares a consistent training process with the flagship series, ensuring it possesses a solid foundation of general capabilities:

1.  **Large-scale pre-training**: Trained on up to **15 trillion tokens of general corpus** to build extensive knowledge understanding capabilities;
2.  **Specialized domain optimization**: Enhanced training on critical tasks such as code generation, logical reasoning, and agent interaction;
3.  **Long context support**: Context length extended to **128K tokens**, capable of handling long documents, complex conversations, or large code projects;
4.  **Reinforcement learning enhancement**: RL optimizes the model's decision-making capabilities in areas such as inference planning and tool calling.

This training system endows GLM-4.5-Air with excellent generalization capabilities and task adaptability.

**‚öôÔ∏è Core Capabilities Optimized for Agents**

GLM-4.5-Air is deeply adapted for agent application scenarios and possesses the following practical capabilities:

‚úÖ **Tool Calling Support**: Can call external tools via standardized interfaces to achieve task automation\
‚úÖ **Web Browsing and Information Extraction**: Can work with browser plugins to understand and interact with dynamic content\
‚úÖ **Software Engineering Assistance**: Supports requirements analysis, code generation, defect identification, and repair\
‚úÖ **Frontend Development Support**: Has a good understanding and generation capability for frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This model can be flexibly integrated into code agent frameworks such as **Claude Code and Roo Code**, and can also be used as the core engine for any custom Agent.

**üí° Intelligent "Thinking Mode," Flexible Response to Various Requests**

GLM-4.5-Air supports **hybrid inference mode**, allowing users to control whether deep thinking is enabled via the `thinking.type` parameter:

*   `enabled`: Enables thinking, suitable for complex tasks requiring step-by-step reasoning or planning
*   `disabled`: Disables thinking, used for simple queries or immediate responses
*   Default setting is **dynamic thinking mode**, where the model automatically determines whether deep analysis is needed

| Task Type                             | Example                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Tasks** (thinking recommended to be off) | <p>- Query "When was Zhipu AI founded?"<br>- Translate "I love you" to Chinese</p>                          |
| **Medium Tasks** (thinking recommended to be on)  | <p>- Compare the pros and cons of planes vs. high-speed trains from Beijing to Shanghai<br>- Explain why Jupiter has many moons</p> |
| **Complex Tasks** (thinking strongly recommended to be on) | <p>- Explain how experts collaborate in MoE models<br>- Analyze whether to buy an ETF based on market information</p> |
