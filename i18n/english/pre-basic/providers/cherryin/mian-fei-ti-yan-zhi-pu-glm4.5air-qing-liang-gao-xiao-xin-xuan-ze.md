**üöÄ What is GLM-4.5-Air?**

GLM-4.5-Air is Zhipu's latest high-performance language model, featuring an advanced **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture**. It significantly reduces computational resource consumption while maintaining excellent inference capabilities.

*   **Total Parameters: 106 Billion**
*   **Active Parameters: 12 Billion**

Through its streamlined design, GLM-4.5-Air achieves higher inference efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments while still capable of handling complex tasks.

**üìö Unified Training Process, Solidifying Intelligent Foundations**

GLM-4.5-Air shares a consistent training process with its flagship series, ensuring it possesses a solid foundation of general capabilities:

1.  **Large-scale Pre-training**: Trained on up to **15 trillion tokens of general corpus** to build extensive knowledge comprehension abilities;
2.  **Specialized Domain Optimization**: Enhanced training on key tasks such as code generation, logical reasoning, and agent interaction;
3.  **Long Context Support**: Context length extended to **128K tokens**, capable of processing long documents, complex dialogues, or large code projects;
4.  **Reinforcement Learning Enhancement**: RL optimization improves the model's decision-making capabilities in inference planning, tool calling, and other aspects.

This training system endows GLM-4.5-Air with excellent generalization and task adaptation capabilities.

**‚öôÔ∏è Core Capabilities Optimized for Agents**

GLM-4.5-Air is deeply adapted for agent application scenarios, offering the following practical capabilities:

‚úÖ **Tool Calling Support**: Can call external tools via standardized interfaces to automate tasks\
‚úÖ **Web Browsing and Information Extraction**: Can work with browser plugins to understand and interact with dynamic content\
‚úÖ **Software Engineering Assistance**: Supports requirements parsing, code generation, defect identification, and repair\
‚úÖ **Front-end Development Support**: Has a good understanding and generation capability for front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This model can be flexibly integrated into code agent frameworks like **Claude Code** and **Roo Code**, or used as the core engine for any custom Agent.

**üí° Intelligent "Thinking Mode" for Flexible Response to Various Requests**

GLM-4.5-Air supports a **hybrid inference mode**, allowing users to control whether deep thinking is enabled via the `thinking.type` parameter:

*   ``enabled`: Enables thinking, suitable for complex tasks requiring step-by-step reasoning or planning
*   ``disabled`: Disables thinking, used for simple queries or immediate responses
*   Default setting is **dynamic thinking mode**, where the model automatically determines if deep analysis is needed

| Task Type                               | Example                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Tasks** (Thinking recommended to be disabled)   | <p>- Query "When was Zhipu AI founded?"<br>- Translate "I love you" into Chinese</p>   |
| **Medium Tasks** (Thinking recommended to be enabled)   | <p>- Compare the pros and cons of taking a plane vs. high-speed rail from Beijing to Shanghai<br>- Explain why Jupiter has many moons</p>      |
| **Complex Tasks** (Thinking strongly recommended to be enabled) | <p>- Explain how experts collaborate in MoE models<br>- Analyze whether to buy ETFs based on market information</p> |
