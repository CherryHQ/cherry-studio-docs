**üöÄ What is Qwen3-8B?**

Qwen3-8B is an **8-billion-parameter dense model** from Alibaba's third-generation Tongyi Qianwen large model series, released in April 2025. It adopts the **Apache 2.0 open-source license**, allowing free use for commercial and research scenarios.

*   **Total Parameters: 8 billion**
*   **Architecture Type: Dense (pure dense structure)**
*   **Context Length: 128K tokens**
*   **Multilingual Support: Covers 119 languages and dialects**

Despite its compact size, Qwen3-8B demonstrates stable performance in reasoning, coding, mathematics, and Agent capabilities, comparable to larger predecessor models, showcasing extremely high practicality in real-world applications.

**üìö Powerful Training Foundation, Small Models Also Have Great Wisdom**

Qwen3-8B is pre-trained on **approximately 36 trillion tokens of high-quality multilingual data**, covering web texts, technical documents, code repositories, and specialized synthetic data, offering broad knowledge coverage.

Its post-training phase introduces a **four-stage reinforcement process**, specifically optimizing the following capabilities:

‚úÖ Natural language understanding and generation\
‚úÖ Mathematical reasoning and logical analysis\
‚úÖ Multilingual translation and expression\
‚úÖ Tool calling and task planning

Thanks to the comprehensive upgrade of its training system, **Qwen3-8B's actual performance approaches or even surpasses Qwen2.5-14B**, achieving a significant leap in parameter efficiency.

**üí° Mixed Inference Mode: Thinking or Quick Response?**

Qwen3-8B supports flexible switching between **"Thinking Mode" and "Non-Thinking Mode"**, allowing users to autonomously choose the response method based on task complexity.

Control modes through the following methods:

*   **API Parameter Setting**: `enable_thinking=True/False`
*   **Prompt Instructions**: Add `/think` or `/no_think` to the input

| Mode              | Applicable Scenarios                   | Examples                                          |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Thinking Mode** | Complex reasoning, math problems, planning tasks | <p>- Solving geometric problems<br>- Writing complete project architecture</p> |
| **Non-Thinking Mode** | Quick Q&A, translation, summarization      | <p>- Querying weather<br>- Chinese-English translation</p>      |

This design allows users to **freely balance response speed and reasoning depth**, enhancing the user experience.
