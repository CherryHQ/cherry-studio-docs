**The well-known MaaS service platform "SiluFlow" provides free access to the Qwen3-8B model call service for everyone.** As a cost-effective member of the Tongyi Qianwen Qwen3 series, Qwen3-8B achieves powerful capabilities in a compact size, making it an ideal choice for intelligent applications and efficient development.

***

**üöÄ What is Qwen3-8B?**

Qwen3-8B is an **8-billion parameter dense model** in the third-generation large model series of Tongyi Qianwen, released by Alibaba in April 2025. It adopts the **Apache 2.0 open-source license** and can be freely used for commercial and research scenarios.

*   **Total Parameters: 8 billion**
*   **Architecture Type: Dense (pure dense structure)**
*   **Context Length: 128K tokens**
*   **Multilingual Support: Covers 119 languages and dialects**

Despite its compact size, Qwen3-8B demonstrates stable performance in inference, code, mathematics, and Agent capabilities, comparable to larger previous-generation models, showing extremely high practicality in real-world applications.

**üìö Powerful Training Foundation, Small Model with Big Wisdom**

Qwen3-8B is pre-trained on **approximately 36 trillion tokens of high-quality multilingual data**, covering web text, technical documents, code repositories, and synthetic data from professional fields, providing extensive knowledge coverage.

The subsequent training phase introduced a **four-stage reinforcement process**, specifically optimizing the following capabilities:

‚úÖ Natural language understanding and generation\
‚úÖ Mathematical reasoning and logical analysis\
‚úÖ Multilingual translation and expression\
‚úÖ Tool calling and task planning

Thanks to the comprehensive upgrade of the training system, **Qwen3-8B's actual performance approaches or even surpasses Qwen2.5-14B**, achieving a significant leap in parameter efficiency.

**üí° Hybrid Inference Mode: Think or Respond Quickly?**

Qwen3-8B supports flexible switching between **"Thinking Mode" and "Non-Thinking Mode"**, allowing users to independently choose the response method based on task complexity.

Control modes via the following methods:

*   **API Parameter Setting**: `enable_thinking=True/False`
*   **Prompt Instruction**: Add `/think` or `/no_think` to the input

| Mode             | Applicable Scenarios                  | Examples                                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Thinking Mode**    | Complex reasoning, math problems, planning tasks | <p>- Solve geometric problems<br>- Write complete project architecture</p> |
| **Non-Thinking Mode** | Quick Q&A, translation, summarization       | <p>- Query weather<br>- Chinese-English translation</p>      |

This design allows users to **freely balance response speed and inference depth**, enhancing the user experience.
