Cherry Studio data backup supports backing up data via S3 compatible storage (object storage). Common S3 compatible storage services include: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, and MinIO, among others.

Multi-terminal data synchronization can be achieved based on S3 compatible storage in the following way: `A PC` $$\xrightarrow{\text{Backup}}$$ `S3 Storage` $$\xrightarrow{\text{Restore}}$$ `B PC`.

### Configure S3 Compatible Storage

1.  Create an object storage bucket and record its name. **It is strongly recommended to set the bucket to private read/write to prevent backup data leakage!!**
2.  Refer to the documentation and go to the cloud service console to obtain the `Access Key ID`, `Secret Access Key`, `Endpoint`, `Bucket`, `Region`, and other information for your S3 compatible storage.
    *   **Endpoint**: The access address for S3 compatible storage, typically in the form of `https://<bucket-name>.<region>.amazonaws.com` or `https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`.
    *   **Region**: The region where the bucket is located, such as `us-west-1`, `ap-southeast-1`, etc. For Cloudflare R2, please enter `auto`.
    *   **Bucket**: The name of the bucket.
    *   **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**: Credentials used for authentication.
    *   **Root Path**: Optional, specifies the root path when backing up to the bucket, defaults to empty.
