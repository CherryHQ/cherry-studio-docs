## Explanation

- **Rank(UB)**: Ranking calculated based on the Bradley-Terry model. This ranking reflects a model's comprehensive performance in the arena and provides an **upper bound** estimate of its Elo score, helping to understand the model's potential competitiveness.
- **Rank(StyleCtrl)**: Ranking after dialogue style control. This ranking aims to reduce preference bias caused by model response styles (e.g., verbose, concise), providing a purer evaluation of the model's core capabilities.
- **Model Name**: Name of the Large Language Model (LLM). This column contains embedded links to relevant model pages; click to jump.
- **Score**: Elo rating obtained by the model through user votes in the arena. The Elo rating is a relative ranking system; a higher score indicates better model performance. This score changes dynamically, reflecting the model's relative strength in the current competitive environment.
- **Confidence Interval**: 95% confidence interval for the model's Elo rating (e.g., `+6/-6`). A smaller interval indicates more stable and reliable model ratings; conversely, a larger interval may indicate insufficient data or fluctuating model performance. It provides a quantitative assessment of rating accuracy.
- **Votes**: Total number of votes the model received in the arena. More votes usually indicate higher statistical reliability of the rating.
- **Provider**: Organization or company providing the model.
- **License**: Model license type, such as Proprietary, Apache 2.0, MIT, etc.
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Date of the training data knowledge cutoff. **No data available** indicates that relevant information was not provided or is unknown.
