## Notes

- **Rank (UB)**: Ranking based on the Bradley-Terry model. This ranking reflects a model's comprehensive performance in the arena and provides an **upper-bound** estimate of its Elo score, helping to understand its potential competitiveness.
- **Rank (StyleCtrl)**: Ranking after dialogue style control. This ranking aims to reduce preference biases caused by response styles (e.g., verbose vs. concise), more purely evaluating a model's core capabilities.
- **Model Name**: Name of the Large Language Model (LLM). Links are embedded—click to navigate.
- **Score**: The Elo rating obtained by the model through user votes. Elo is a relative ranking system where higher scores indicate better performance. This score changes dynamically based on the current competitive environment.
- **Confidence Interval**: 95% confidence interval for the Elo score (e.g., `+6/-6`). A smaller interval indicates more stable and reliable scoring; larger intervals may suggest insufficient data or performance volatility.
- **Votes**: Total votes received by the model. Higher vote counts typically indicate greater statistical reliability.
- **Provider**: Organization or company offering the model.
- **License**: Model license type, e.g., Proprietary, Apache 2.0, MIT, etc.
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Date of the model's training data cutoff. **No Data** indicates unavailable or unknown information.
