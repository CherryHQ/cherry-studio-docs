We are translating to Greek (Ελληνικά) according to the rules.
 Steps:
 1. Preserve markdown structure exactly.
 2. Translate only the textual content that will be displayed to the user, including:
    - Headings: but note, the first two headings are in English and should remain so (as per rule 8 for table of contents? But this is not the table of contents file). However, in this document, we are translating the main title and other headings. But note: the first heading is in Chinese and should be translated to Greek.
    - Paragraphs.
    - Text within hint blocks ({% hint style="info" %} ... {% endhint %}).
    - Table of contents? No, this is not a SUMMARY.md.
 3. Do not translate:
    - Markdown syntax (like #, ##, **, etc.)
    - Links and image paths (e.g., [Gemini-2.5-Pro](http://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-pro) remains the same)
    - Code blocks: but note, there are no code blocks here, but tables. We should not translate the table structure, only the text in the table cells. However, the table headers (like "排名(UB)", etc.) should be translated.
    - Technical terms: e.g., "pull request", "fork", etc. But in this context, we have model names, which are proper nouns and should not be translated. Also, terms like "Elo" are to remain.
    - URLs, file paths, version numbers, model names (even if they contain English), and the data in the table that is not text (like numbers, dates) remain unchanged.

 Important: The document has a table with many rows. We must translate the column headers and the explanatory text below the table, but not the model names, links, numbers, etc.

 Let's break down:

 Title: "# LLM Arena 排行榜 (实时更新)" -> Translate to Greek: "# Πίνακας κατάταξης LLM Arena (σε πραγματικό χρόνο)"

 Then, the paragraph: "这是一个基于 Chatbot Arena (lmarena.ai) 数据的排行榜，通过自动化流程生成。" -> Translate.

 Then the blockquote: "> **数据更新时间**: ..." -> Translate the text but keep the date and time as is.

 Hint block: 
   {% hint style="info" %}
  点击排行榜中的 **模型名称** 可跳转至其详细信息或试用页面。
   {% endhint %} 
   -> Translate the Greek text inside, but keep the structure.

 Table: 
   We have headers: 
     排名(UB) -> Θέση (UB)
     排名(StyleCtrl) -> Θέση (StyleCtrl)
     模型名 -> Όνομα μοντέλου
     分数 -> Βαθμολογία
     置信区间 -> Διάστημα εμπιστοσύνης
     票数 -> Ψήφοι
     服务商 -> Πάροχος
     许可协议 -> Άδεια
     知识截止日期 -> Ημερομηνία λήξης γνώσης

   Then in the table, we must not change the model names (they are links and proper nouns), the numbers, the dates, the words like "Proprietary", "MIT", "nan", etc.

 After the table, there are explanations for each column. These should be translated.

 Also, the "说明" section (which is like an explanation) and the "数据来源与更新频率" and "免责声明" sections must be translated.

 Note: The phrase "暂无数据" in the table (which appears in the "知识截止日期" column) should be translated to Greek as "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα" (or similar). But note that it appears in the table multiple times. However, we must be cautious: in the row for model "121" it is "暂无数据", but also in model "140" and "161". We must translate only the text in the table that is in Chinese? Actually, the rule says to translate the textual content. But note that the table has a mix of Chinese and English. So we translate the Chinese text in the table, but leave the English and other data as is.

 However, the table has 266 rows and in the column "知识截止日期" we have some Chinese text. We must change only that specific cell? But we cannot change the structure. We are going to output the entire table exactly as in the original, but when we see Chinese text in a cell, we translate it to Greek.

 But note: the entire document is to be processed. So we'll go through and translate the Chinese text to Greek, leaving the rest as is.

 How to handle the table? We must translate the header row and then for each row, if there is Chinese in the "服务商", "许可协议", or "知识截止日期" columns, we translate them? Actually:

 - "服务商" column: contains both English and Chinese (e.g., "01 AI", "阿里巴巴" becomes "Alibaba", but in the table we see "Alibaba" already? Actually in the original table, the service provider is in English? Let me check: 
   The original Chinese table: 
     服务商: Google, xAI, Z.ai, ... then we have "01 AI" which is in English? But also we have "阿里巴巴" which is "Alibaba". However, in the provided table, the service provider column is already in English (e.g., "Google", "Alibaba", etc.)? Actually, looking at the sample row: 
        |        3 |               2 | [GLM-4.5](https://z.ai/blog/glm-4.5) ... | Z.ai | MIT | nan | ... 
     So the service provider is in English. But what about the next row? 
        |        4 |               2 | [Grok-4-0709](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-4-0709) ... | xAI | Proprietary | nan | ... 
     So it's in English.

   However, in the "许可协议" column we have terms like "Proprietary", "MIT", etc. which are in English? But also sometimes in Chinese? Actually, looking at the table, it's all in English? 

   The only column that has Chinese text is the "知识截止日期" column. We see:
        "nan", "2023/10", and also "暂无数据" (which means no data available).

   So we must translate "暂无数据" to Greek. We'll translate it as "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα".

   Also, in the row for model 121 (Yi-Large-preview) and others, we have "暂无数据", so we change that.

   But note: we cannot change the other non-Chinese text in the table.

 Approach: We'll output the table exactly as is, but when we come across a cell that has the string "暂无数据", we replace it with "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα". Similarly, if there are other Chinese strings in the table, we'll translate them. However, from the sample, it's only "暂无数据".

 Also note: the "说明" section below the table has a bulleted list. We must translate the Chinese text to Greek.

 And the last sections: "数据来源与更新频率" and "免责声明".

 Let's translate step by step.

 However, note: the table is very long. We are not going to change the numbers or the links, only the Chinese text in the table (which is only in the "知识截止日期" column for some rows) and the table headers.

 How about the "服务商" column? In the original table, it's in English? But wait, in the row for model 78: 
     服务商: "01 AI" -> but in the next row (79) it's "OpenAI", etc. So we leave as is.

 Let's code the translation:

 1. Translate the main heading.
 2. Translate the paragraph.
 3. Translate the blockquote: note that the blockquote contains a date and time in a specific format. We must leave the date and time as is, and translate the label.
 4. Translate the hint block.
 5. Translate the section heading "## 排行榜" to "## Πίνακας κατάταξης".
 6. For the table, output the header row with translated headers, then for each row, output the same row but if in the last column (知识截止日期) the content is "暂无数据", replace it with "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα". For other cells, leave as is.
 7. Then translate the "说明" section and the rest.

 Important: We must not change the alignment colons (e.g., :---) in the table.

 However, note that the table has 9 columns. We have to replace only the last column when it equals "暂无数据", or are there other Chinese strings? Also, in the row for model 121 and 132, the last column has "暂无数据", and in model 140 and 161 it's "暂无数据" as well? Actually, I see multiple occurrences.

 But note: we must be cautious because there might be other Chinese strings in other columns? From the data, it seems only the last column has Chinese. And also note that there are some models with service provider in Chinese? Actually, no, because in the table the service provider is written in English (like "01 AI", "Alibaba",
