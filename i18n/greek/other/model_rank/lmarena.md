We are translating a Chinese document to Greek (Ελληνικά). We must strictly follow the translation rules:
 1. Translate only the textual content that will be displayed to the user.
 2. Preserve all Markdown formatting and structural elements (headings, lists, code blocks, blockquotes, bold, italics, links, images, tables, etc.) without translating the Markdown syntax.
 3. Translate comments within code blocks, but leave code, commands, file names, URLs, version numbers, and other technical syntax unchanged.
 4. Preserve links and image paths unchanged.
 5. Maintain GitBook-style hint block structure: translate the content inside `{% hint %}` tags but leave the tags unchanged.
 6. Keep Frontmatter (YAML header) unchanged.
 7. Do not add any extra explanations, prefaces, postscripts, or summaries.
 8. For a table of contents file (which this isn't, as it doesn't start with "# Table of contents" and "## Cherry Studio"), we would only translate title names and keep links unchanged. However, this is not a SUMMARY.md file.
 9. Preserve all GitHub-specific terminology (e.g., pull request, fork, commit, repository) in the original language (English) as they are proper nouns. But note: in the context of translation, we are translating the surrounding text, but terms like "pull request" might remain in English. However, the instructions say to preserve them. Since the target language is Greek, we will translate the descriptive text but leave such terms as they are (in English) if they are considered technical terms. But note the rule says: "Preserve all GitHub-specific terminology". So we keep the terms like "pull request" in English. However, the current content doesn't have such terms in the text to be translated. The table contains terms like "Proprietary", "MIT", which are licenses and should remain as is.
 10. Preserve all URLs, file paths, and version numbers exactly as in the original.
 11. Maintain the original document structure and paragraph breaks.

 Important: The target language is Greek (Ελληνικά).

 Let's break down the document:

 1. Title: "# LLM Arena 排行榜 (实时更新)" -> We translate the title but keep the formatting. The "(实时更新)" part means "real-time update". So the Greek title should be: "# LLM Arena Κατάταξη (Σε πραγματικό χρόνο)"

 2. A paragraph: "这是一个基于 Chatbot Arena (lmarena.ai) 数据的排行榜，通过自动化流程生成。" 
    -> This is a description: "This is a leaderboard based on Chatbot Arena (lmarena.ai) data, generated through an automated process."

 3. A blockquote: "> **数据更新时间**: 2025-08-28 11:40:47 UTC / 2025-08-28 19:40:47 CST (北京时间)"
    -> We translate the text but keep the date and time as is. The translation: "> **Χρόνος ενημέρωσης δεδομένων**: 2025-08-28 11:40:47 UTC / 2025-08-28 19:40:47 CST (北京时间)"

    Note: "(北京时间)" is "Beijing Time". We can translate it to "(Πεκινικού ώρα)" or keep it as "(北京时间)"? But the rule says preserve version numbers and such. Since it's a time zone, we can translate the label. However, the rule 10 says "Preserve all URLs, file paths, and version numbers". This is not a URL, file path, or version number. It's a time zone label. We'll translate it to "(Ώρα Πεκίνου)".

 4. A hint block ({% hint style="info" %} ... {% endhint %}) with text: "点击排行榜中的 **模型名称** 可跳转至其详细信息或试用页面。"
    -> We translate the content: "Κάντε κλικ στο **όνομα μοντέλου** στον πίνακα κατάταξης για να μεταβείτε στη σελίδα λεπτομερειών ή δοκιμής."

 5. Section: "## 排行榜" -> "## Πίνακας κατάταξης"

 6. A large table: We must translate the header row and any text in the table that is not a link, code, or technical term that should remain. The headers are:
    - 排名(UB) -> Κατάταξη (UB)
    - 排名(StyleCtrl) -> Κατάταξη (StyleCtrl)
    - 模型名 -> Όνομα μοντέλου
    - 分数 -> Βαθμολογία
    - 置信区间 -> Διάστημα εμπιστοσύνης
    - 票数 -> Ψήφοι
    - 服务商 -> Πάροχος
    - 许可协议 -> Άδεια χρήσης
    - 知识截止日期 -> Ημερομηνία τερματισμού γνώσης

    However, note that the table body contains mainly numbers, links, and technical terms that we should not translate. For example, model names like "Gemini-2.5-Pro" remain, and provider names like "Google" should remain as they are. License types like "Proprietary", "MIT", etc. remain unchanged. The "知识截止日期" column has entries like "nan", "2023/10", "暂无数据" (which we translate to "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα").

    But note: the rule says to translate comments in code blocks? This table is not a code block. We only translate the textual content that is meant for the user. The table has some Chinese text in the body: "暂无数据" appears many times. We must translate that to Greek: "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα".

    However, note that in the table, the first column is rank, which is numbers. The second column is also rank. Then the model name is a link with text that is the model name (we don't translate the model names). The score is a number. Confidence interval is like "+5/-5" - we leave as is. Votes is a number. Service provider is in English (e.g., "Google") or in Chinese? Looking at the table, the service providers are in English or Chinese? Actually, the service provider column has: "Google", "Z.ai", "xAI", etc. — so they are in English. But there are some Chinese ones? Actually, the example shows both English and Chinese? Wait, in the table we see "Alibaba", "DeepSeek", "Tencent", "Zhipu AI", but also we see "暂无数据" in the knowledge cutoff date. So for that column, we must translate the Chinese text.

    Specifically, the columns to check for translatable text:
    - The headers: we translate as above.
    - The model names: the displayed text is the model name (which we do not translate) and they are inside links. We do not change the link or the anchor text because model names are proper nouns.
    - The provider column: already in English or Chinese? In the sample row: "服务商" -> "Google", "Z.ai", etc. So they are in English. We don't change.
    - The license column: same, already in English.
    - The knowledge cutoff column: contains:
        - "nan": leave as is? Actually, it stands for "not a number", but we can leave as "nan".
        - Dates like "2023/10": leave as is.
        - "Online": leave as is? Or translate? It means the model is continuously updated? The rule says preserve technical terms. Since it's a status, we can leave as "Online".
        - "暂无数据": translate to "Δεν υπάρχουν δεδομένα" (meaning "no data available").
        - Also, note that one row has "2024年9月" which is "2024/9" -> we can leave as "2024/9".

    However, note: the rule says "Preserve all URLs, file paths, and version numbers". The knowledge cutoff is a date or a string. We are allowed to translate "暂无数据" because it's a user-facing message meaning "no data available".

    But note: the entire table is inside a Markdown table. We must be careful not to alter the structure.

 7. The next section: "## 说明" -> "## Επεξήγηση"

 8. The bullet points under "说明": We translate each bullet point, preserving the structure and the bold text.

    - "**排名(UB)**：基于 Bradley-Terry 模型计算的排名。此排名反映了模型在竞技场中的综合表现，并提供了其 Elo 分数的 **上界** 估计，帮助理解模型的潜在竞争力。"

      Translation: 
        "**Κατάταξη (UB)**: Κατάταξη που υπολογίζεται με βάση το μοντέλο Bradley-Terry. Αυτή η κατάταξη αντικατοπτρίζει τη συνολική απόδοση του μοντέλου στην αρένα και παρέχει μια **άνω όριο** εκτίμησης του σκορ Elo, βοηθώντας στην κατανόηση της δυνητικής ανταγωνιστικότη
