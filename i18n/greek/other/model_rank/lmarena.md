We are translating from Chinese to Greek (Ελληνικά). We must strictly preserve all Markdown formatting, links, URLs, and technical terms.
 Steps:
 1. Translate only the textual content that will be displayed to the user.
 2. Preserve all Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, code blocks, blockquotes, bold, italics, links, images, tables, etc.
 3. Translate comments within code blocks? In this document, there are no code blocks with comments, but note that the table content needs translation except for the links and technical terms.
 4. Preserve links and image paths unchanged.
 5. Maintain GitBook-style hint blocks: translate the content inside `{% hint ... %}` but leave the tags.
 6. Frontmatter: none in this document.
 7. Do not add any extra explanations.
 8. For tables: translate the header row and the content of the cells that are in natural language, but leave the links, model names, numbers, dates, etc. as they are.

 Important: The table has a header row and many rows. We must translate the headers and any other text in the table that is in Chinese, but leave the links, numbers, and other non-textual elements.

 Let's break down the document:

 - Title: "# LLM Arena 排行榜 (实时更新)" -> translate to Greek
 - Paragraph: "这是一个基于 Chatbot Arena (lmarena.ai) 数据的排行榜，通过自动化流程生成。"
 - Blockquote: "> **数据更新时间**: ..." -> translate the text but keep the date and time as is.
 - Hint block: `{% hint style="info" %}` ... `{% endhint %}` -> translate the content inside.
 - Table: 
      - Headers: "排名(UB)", "排名(StyleCtrl)", "模型名", "分数", "置信区间", "票数", "服务商", "许可协议", "知识截止日期"
      - The table body: most cells contain numbers, links, or fixed terms (like "Proprietary", "MIT", "暂无数据"), which should not be translated. But note that the model names that are linked are in English and should remain. However, the text in the model name column that is not a link (i.e., the part that is the name) is in English and should remain. The only exception is if there was Chinese in the model name? In this table, the model names are in English. So we only translate the headers and the text in the "服务商" and "许可协议" columns? Actually, the "服务商" and "许可协议" columns have English terms too? Looking: 
          - 服务商: "Google", "OpenAI", etc. -> leave as is.
          - 许可协议: "Proprietary", "MIT", "Apache 2.0", etc. -> leave as is.
          - 知识截止日期: "暂无数据", "2023/10", etc. -> "暂无数据" should be translated? But note: the rule says "Preserve all URLs, file paths, and version numbers". However, "暂无数据" is a phrase meaning "no data available". We should translate that. Similarly, the dates are in a fixed format and should be preserved? Actually, the dates are in the format "2023/10", which is a year/month and should be preserved. But "暂无数据" is a text that should be translated.
